Task 1: Understanding Flexbox Basics
- What is flexbox?
    Flexbox, formally known as the CSS Flexible Box Layout module, is a one-dimensional layout model in CSS designed for arranging items within a container (the flex container) along a single axis, either as a row or as a column. 
- Why flexbox is better than others?
    Flexbox is better than traditional layout methods like floats or inline-block because it makes alignment, spacing, and responsiveness much easier and cleaner. It allows you to center elements both vertically and horizontally, control direction, reorder items without changing HTML, and automatically adjust layout based on screen size â€” all with less code and no hacks.
