Task 1: Understanding Flexbox Basics
- What is flexbox?
    Flexbox, formally known as the CSS Flexible Box Layout module, is a one-dimensional layout model in CSS designed for arranging items within a container (the flex container) along a single axis, either as a row or as a column. 
- Why flexbox is better than others?
    Flexbox is better than traditional layout methods like floats or inline-block because it makes alignment, spacing, and responsiveness much easier and cleaner. It allows you to center elements both vertically and horizontally, control direction, reorder items without changing HTML, and automatically adjust layout based on screen size — all with less code and no hacks.

Task 2: Aligning elements
- How to align elements horizontally and vertically  using Flexbox?
    To align elements using Flexbox:
        Main axis (horizontal by default): use justify-content
        Cross axis (vertical by default): use align-items

Task 3: Flex Axes and Properties
- What is the difference between the main axis and the cross axis in Flexbox?
    In Flexbox, layout is controlled using two axes:
        Main Axis: The primary direction in which flex items are laid out.
            It depends on the flex-direction property.
            row (default) → main axis is horizontal
            column → main axis is vertical
        Cross Axis: The direction perpendicular to the main axis.
            If flex-direction: row, then cross axis is vertical
            If flex-direction: column, then cross axis is horizontal
